# Question 3

The juggler sequence is described as follows. Beginning with an input a1, the next term is defined by the recurrence relation

![juggler](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/1/9d1af7330f4e9f3f45b6c8e2779b7634.png)

The sequence terminates when it reaches 1, as all subsequent terms would then be 1.

## Task

Given an input n greater than or equal to 2, write a program/function/generator/etc. that outputs/returns the respective juggler sequence. The output can be in any reasonable form. You may not use a built-in that computes the juggler sequence, or any built-in that directly yields the result. You may assume that the sequence terminates in 1.

## Test Cases

    Input: output
    2: 2, 1
    3: 3, 5, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
    4: 4, 2, 1
    5: 5, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
